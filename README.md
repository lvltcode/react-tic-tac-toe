## User Stories

The following **required** functionalities are completed (this is a sample):

* [x] Milestone 1: Create a new application, and create a new file. You can call it whatever you like; why not blog.py. Create your main routes. For now, itâ€™s okay to have everything in one file as our app will stay simple.
* [x] Milestone 2: For this application, we'll keep things simple and not have a real user authentication system; we only need one table for now. Define your model for `Post`. It should have a few fields:
  ** id (always)
  ** title
  ** body
  ** author_name
  ** created_at
  ** updated_at
* [x] Milestone 3: Create your first form. The most common framework is Flask-WTF, but we'll learn that later. What's nice about Flask is we can build simple solutions first.
* [x] Milestone 4: Add Bootstrap and some Styling. To do this, we'll have to use template inheritance. Your pages probably don't have a nice head, body, and consistent style, nav bar, footer, that sort of stuff that you're probably used to. 
* [x] Milestone 5: Flash Messages / Error Feedback. We redirect to posts right away when we create a new post, whether it was successful or not.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Implement Time Travel Feature
